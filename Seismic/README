# inversion of refraction data
###############################
In plot_5_Houghall.ipynb the python suite PYGiMLI is used to invert refration seismics.
The input is SeisHoughall2017.sgt
The input file is generated from the mathematica file bedrockto_gimli.nb which includes some arrival times from the 2017 fieldwork.
The structure of the input sgt file is this:
	-total number of geophones + shot positions (e.g. 24 geophones and 7 shots -> 31 datapoints)
	-positions of shots and geophones in a single sequence, ordered from smallest to largest offset.
	-total number of picked arrival times
	-arrival times in sequence, shot by shot. 
	 The first column indicates how to find the shot position in the sequence at the top of the file.
	 The second column indicates how to find the geophone position in the sequence at the top of the file.
	 This is why the file is sgt (shot, geophone, time).
	 For example, if the first, second and ninth values in the initial sequence indicate positions of shots,
	 but third to eighth, then tenth value and eleventh and so on indicate positions of geophones,
	 then the first series of arrivales will be in three columns reporting :
	 1	3	0.022 
	 1	4	0.033
	 1	5	0.033
	 1	6	0.033
	 1	7	0.033
	 1	8	0.033
	 1	10	0.033
	 1	11	0.033
	 ....  and then the second series:
	 2	3	0.022 
	 2	4	0.033
	 2	5	0.033
	 2	6	0.033
	 2	7	0.033
	 2	8	0.033
	 2	10	0.033
	 2	11	0.033
	 ..... and the third (third shot, at 9th position):
	 9	3	0.022 
	 9	4	0.033
	 9	5	0.033
	 9	6	0.033
	 9	7	0.033
	 9	8	0.033
	 9	10	0.033
	 9	11	0.033
	 ..... etc etc
